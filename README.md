# DatabaseProject
PHP using XAMPP to run  mysql db and Apache webserver. The final project for class. Enter at login.php.

## TODO MANDATORY
- Make login work (make just an admin profile that we all log into maybe? And every other login fails?)
- Once you log in it should take you to either a home page where you can choose to go to the book manager or user manager (or any other pages that we have) or it should just take you directly to the book manager page if no other pages have been made.
- The book manager has forms for every CRUD operation and will allow users to perform database operations such as adding and deleting books. The functionality behind each form has been split up into individual operations (Create, read (search), update, delete) and separate files have been made to handle each operation. This should different people to work on different operations without merge conflict. This step can be shared amongst several people.

## TODO OPTIONAL
- Create a user manager page and have CRUD operations for users as well. This should list all users and allow you to make changes to their usernames, passwords, and any other information
- Add sign up page to create user accounts
- Make pages look good (add css)
